#detect returns the first for which the block is true

#my original solution. sets a default value outside of the if scope. so
#that if the if condition is never met, we method will still return the
#default value we need it to.
#the detect method is more intuitive since it's default return value is true or false.
#whereas the return value of each is the original array

#def won?(board)
#  winning = false
#  WIN_COMBINATIONS.each do |win_combination|
#    win_index_1 = win_combination[0]  #assigning variables to use the wininng index variable later
#    win_index_2 = win_combination[1]
#    win_index_3 = win_combination[2]

#    position_1 = board[win_index_1]  #evaluates the value of board at board[1] for example. could be X or O or nil
#    position_2 = board[win_index_2]
#    position_3 = board[win_index_3]

#    if (position_1 == "X" && position_2 == "X" && position_3 == "X") || (position_1 == "O" && position_2 == "O" && position_3 == "O")

#original answer. This is way too long and convuluted
#def draw?(board)
#  draw = false
#  if (won?(board) == false)
#    if (full?(board) == true)

#the formal solution relies only on a single comparative line of logic

#my solution first ensures that the return of won?(board) ISN"T nil.
#we can also account for this with a simplified if statement and the first method
#first returns the first element or the first n elements of the array.
#KEY-- if the array is empty, the first form returns nil
#example
#a = ["q", "r", "s", "t"]
#a.first #=> "q"
#a.first(2) #=> ["q", "r"]

#def winner(board)
#  if won?(board) != false
#    win_combination = won?(board)
#    return board[win_combination[0]]
#  end
#end

def winner(board)
  if win_combo = won?(board) #remember won?(board) has a default return value of
    # true or false. this reads, if won?combo is true, then assign the return
    #value of the method (the winning indexes) to win_combo.
    board[win_combo.first] #goes into array win_combo[0,1,2] and
    #returns the board value at the first winning indice. aka goes into
    #board[0--or whatever the first winning indices]
